## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Move)
- `sources/types.move`: Core data structures and event definitions.
- `sources/binary_option_market.move`: Main binary options contract (market logic, events, settlement, claim, withdraw fee, registry, view functions).
- `sources/pyth_price_adapter.move`: Oracle price integration (Pyth).
- **Test**: `tests/binary_option_market_tests.move` – Unit tests for contract logic.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (TypeScript, React)
- **UI**: Chakra UI, Recharts, Chart.js
- **Wallet Integration**: @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react, multi-wallet support
- **Data**: On-chain fetch via Aptos fullnode REST API
- **Project Structure**:
  - `frontend/src/components/`: UI, charts, wallet, market cards, owner/customer panels
  - `frontend/src/services/`: Data fetching, price feeds, event listeners
  - `frontend/src/config/`: Network, contract, and trading pair configs
  - `frontend/src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `frontend/src/layouts/`: Main layout components
  - `frontend/src/themes/`: Chakra UI theme
  - `frontend/src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `frontend/src/utils/`: Utility functions
  - `frontend/pages/`: Next.js pages (routing)
  - `frontend/public/`: Asset, logo, font, deployed contract address
