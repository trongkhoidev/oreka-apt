## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Move)
- `types.move`: Core data structures and types
- `market_core.move`: Main binary options contract (market logic, events, settlement)
- `factory.move`: Market deployment factory

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (TypeScript, React)
- **UI**: Chakra UI, Recharts
- **Wallet Integration**: @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react
- **Data**: On-chain fetch via Aptos fullnode REST API, with optional GraphQL for position history

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd frontend
```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env.local` file in `frontend/`:
   ```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_NODE_URL=https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=https://your-graphql-api-endpoint.com/graphql
```
   - (Optional) For backend event filtering:
   ```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:3000
```
4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Usage

### Creating a Market
1. Connect your Aptos wallet
2. Go to "Create Market"
3. Fill in trading pair, strike price, bidding/maturity times, and fee
4. Submit the transaction (on-chain)

### Trading on Markets
1. Browse available markets on the "Markets" page
2. Click a market to view details and charts
3. Place long/short bids during the bidding phase
4. Wait for market maturity and settlement
5. Claim winnings if you are eligible

### Position History & Charts
- The frontend visualizes position history using on-chain events or a GraphQL API for performance.
- To use a custom GraphQL endpoint, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` in your `.env.local`.
- The GraphQL API should provide a `positionHistory(marketAddress: String!): [PositionHistoryPoint!]!` query returning objects with `time`, `long`, and `short` fields.
