# Multi-Outcome Market System Enhancement

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to enhance the current binary option market system to support two types of markets:

1. **Binary Market (Current)**: LONG-SHORT with 2 outcomes
2. **Multi-Outcome Market (New)**: 1 market with multiple outcomes based on price ranges

### Current System Analysis
- Current system supports only binary markets with strike_price
- Uses LONG/SHORT prediction model
- Single outcome resolution (0 for LONG win, 1 for SHORT win)
- All market logic is in `binary_option_market.move`

### Multi-Outcome Market Requirements
- Keep all existing fields from current market
- Replace single `strike_price` with multiple price ranges
- Example: 3 outcomes: A: $100 < final_price < $150, B: final_price > $150, C: final_price < $100
- Support variable number of outcomes (2, 3, 4, etc.)
- Maintain compatibility with existing binary markets

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **Data Structure Design**: Need to support both binary and multi-outcome markets in same system
2. **Bidding Logic**: Adapt bidding system to support multiple outcomes instead of just LONG/SHORT
3. **Resolution Logic**: Determine winning outcome based on final price and price ranges
4. **Claim Logic**: Distribute winnings among multiple outcome pools
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing binary markets continue to work

### Design Decisions
1. **Market Type Field**: Add `market_type` field to distinguish binary vs multi-outcome
2. **Price Ranges**: Use vector of price ranges instead of single strike_price
3. **Outcome Mapping**: Map price ranges to outcome indices
4. **Bid Structure**: Extend Bid struct to support multiple outcome amounts
5. **Resolution**: Determine winning outcome based on which price range contains final_price

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Data Structure Design
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Design new data structures for multi-outcome markets
  - Success Criteria: Define OutcomeRange struct, update Market struct, maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Update MarketInfo struct to support both market types
  - Success Criteria: Add market_type field, support both strike_price and price_ranges
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Extend Bid struct for multiple outcomes
  - Success Criteria: Replace long_amount/short_amount with outcome_amounts vector

### Phase 2: Market Creation Logic
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Create multi-outcome market creation function
  - Success Criteria: Function accepts price ranges and creates multi-outcome market
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Update market registry to handle both market types
  - Success Criteria: Registry stores and retrieves both binary and multi-outcome markets
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Add validation for price ranges
  - Success Criteria: Ensure price ranges are valid and non-overlapping

### Phase 3: Bidding System
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Update bidding logic for multiple outcomes
  - Success Criteria: Users can bid on specific outcomes, not just LONG/SHORT
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Maintain backward compatibility for binary markets
  - Success Criteria: Existing binary market bidding continues to work
- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Update bid tracking and statistics
  - Success Criteria: Track bids per outcome, maintain total statistics

### Phase 4: Resolution System
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Implement multi-outcome resolution logic
  - Success Criteria: Determine winning outcome based on final price and price ranges
- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Update claim logic for multiple outcomes
  - Success Criteria: Distribute winnings correctly among outcome pools
- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Maintain binary market resolution
  - Success Criteria: Existing binary markets resolve correctly

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Create comprehensive tests for multi-outcome markets
  - Success Criteria: All multi-outcome market functions work correctly
- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Test backward compatibility
  - Success Criteria: All existing binary market functionality preserved
- [ ] **Task 5.3**: Integration testing
  - Success Criteria: Both market types work together in same system
